gits-and-shiggles
=================

First ever project. Nothing important shall go here.

This repository exists to help me learn git, management, and possibly even a bit of code. Feel free to do what you want. Yolo, right?
Work on compile script is under branch 'compile'
Heavily commented, Possibly broken.
compile script in master is GNU compatible and automake compatible. Not sure about Cmake, and definitely not python.

I can't believe I just wrote that





Remember: It's all just shits and giggles until somebody giggles and shits.
