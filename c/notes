I have learned that I do not know how to print or acknowledge bash's environemnt variables in C.
the "\
"
character is ignored.
I have attempted to create a newline using /n
but failed. No newline is crreated, but the character itself in inclueded in the final printed text.
int main (){}= main (){}
    Helpful for saving an unbelievably tiny amount of diskspace.
