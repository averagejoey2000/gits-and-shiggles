I have learned that I do not know how to print or acknowledge bash's environemnt variables in C.
the "\
"
character is ignored.
I have attempted to create a newline using /n
but failed. No newline is crreated, but the character itself in inclueded in the final printed text.
int main (){}= main (){}
    Helpful for saving an unbelievably tiny amount of diskspace.
Pointers to a function
	int (*pointername)(int a, int b)
	int callme(int a, int b)
	int (*callme)(int a, int b)
	int (*compare_cb)(int a, int b)

	int (*tester)(int a, int b) = sorted order;
	printf("TEST: %d is the same as %d\n", tester(2, 3), sorted_order(2, 3));

    Write it: char *make_coolness(int awesome_levels)
    Wrap it: char *(*make_coolness)(int awesome_levels)
    Rename it: char *(*coolness_cb)(int awesome_levels)
